Web3 Safe UX Design

A user-centered approach to secure crypto transfers by transforming blockchain addresses into Identity Objects.
This repository aims to prevent human errors that can lead to massive losses, like sending funds to malicious addresses.

The authors do not provide financial advice and are not responsible for any financial loss, misuse, or damage resulting from the use of this repository, its code, or mockups.

Important:
	•	Mockups are demo-only and should not be used with real funds.
	•	Users must always verify addresses independently before sending any cryptocurrency.
	•	Forking or modifying this project does not transfer any responsibility from the user.
	•	This project follows Cypherpunk principles: identity verification is decentralized, anonymous, and privacy-preserving.

Problem Statement

Blockchain addresses are long hex strings that are difficult for humans to verify, causing high-risk transactions. Mistakes can lead to financial loss.

⸻

Solution: Identity Objects

We propose treating every blockchain address as a human-readable, verifiable, and privacy-preserving identity:
	•	Avatar & Color Coding: Quickly identify recipients visually.
	•	Human-readable Badges: Verified, Trusted, Recently Used.
	•	Trust Score: Evaluate risk before sending funds, calculated decentralized and locally.
	•	Transaction History Verification: Show previous verified transfers directly from the blockchain.
	•	Copy-Paste Safety: Visual feedback when copied addresses match a trusted Identity Object.
	•	Privacy First: Actual addresses are stored hashed locally to preserve anonymity.

⸻

Features
	•	Transform blockchain addresses into human-readable, privacy-preserving Identity Objects.
	•	Visual verification via avatars, color coding, and badges.
	•	Trust score and transaction history for safer transactions.
	•	Copy-paste safety alerts.
	•	Fully illustrative and educational UX design examples.
	•	Decentralized verification to maintain anonymity and user control.

⸻

User Flow
	1.	User enters recipient address.
	2.	System generates or retrieves Identity Object (hashed, privacy-preserving).
	3.	Display avatar, color code, trust score, transaction history.
	4.	User verifies information locally before sending funds.
	5.	Confirmation screen shows meaningful visual cues:

“You are sending $50M USDT to Alice (Verified) — Green Badge”

Code Example

const IdentityObject = require('./src/identityObject.js');

const alice = new IdentityObject(
  '0xA1b2C3d4E5f6...',
  'Alice Johnson',
  'alice-avatar.png',
  true,
  98,
  [{ amount: 1000000, currency: 'USDT', verified: true }]
);

console.log(alice.summary());
console.log(alice.isTrustedAddress('0xA1b2C3d4E5f6...'));
console.log(alice.isTrustedAddress('0xB2c3D4e5F6g7...'));
console.log(alice.transactionHistory());
