⚠️ Important Warnings
	•	Educational / Illustrative Only: This project is for demo, learning, and UX experimentation.
	•	No Real Funds: Do not use this code or mockups with real cryptocurrency.
	•	User Responsibility: Always verify all addresses and transactions independently.
	•	Experimental Code: The example code is not production-ready and may change.
	•	Privacy Principles: All Identity Objects are privacy-preserving; actual addresses are hashed locally.
